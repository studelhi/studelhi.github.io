I"Q<p>The Student Tenantsâ€™ Union, Delhi is a united student-led group formed to connect with student tenants across the NCT of Delhi. Our aim is to provide a safe space for students, living in rented accommodations like PGs, flats, or private student hostels, to voice their concerns regarding tenancy. We seek to unionize and collectively fight for our rights and make each other aware of the existing tenancy laws pertaining to students. In the face of rampant discrimination from landlords based on social location, religion, gender, caste, region, besides moral policing, unjust curfew timings, threats of eviction and other related problems, especially in the present situation of crisis, we must come together and strengthen our fight against such injustice!</p>
